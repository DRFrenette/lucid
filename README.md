#Lucid
## A clean, fluid application built to help combat writer's block. Built on
Rails.
#### Work in progress

### Summary

Lucid is my capstone project as part of the Metis bootcamp (powered by
thoughtbot). Lucid is an app built to give writers both a clean place to write
their thoughts, as well as a simple system to organize them. There is also a
dedicated area where users can submit and vote on prompts for those times when
you really just need a change of pace when working on a large project such as a
novel or screenplay.
